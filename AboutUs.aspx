            <h1>About Us</h1>
            The Book Nook was founded in October 2015 to extend our brick-and-mortar store front in Chicago, IL.<br />
            This is a place for our customers to enjoy all that we have to offer without having to stop by our physical location!<br />
            You can find all of our books listed on our website, and can even read and add reviews from others.<br />
            So stop by and pick out a good book to read, you won't regret it!
